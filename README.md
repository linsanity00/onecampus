Run the project by typing "flask run" in a terminal window. This should give you a link to the website,
which should be http://ide50-linzhu.cs50.io:8080. To see how the website looks for someone who has
already joined clubs and is a club administrator, log in with the credentials "username: rlisk" and
"password: rlisk." To start from scratch as a new user, click register and create a new account. Use
your @college.harvard.edu email, or the website will reject your attempt at registration.

Once you're logged in with a new account, you'll see the dashboard page, which is the homepage for
OneCampus. Once you have joined clubs, this page will have links to the individual club pages and
a list of events that you have RSVP'ed for, but for now, it's blank. The first step is to join clubs--
Go to the "find clubs" link on the sidebar and select a category, then choose any club(s) and click
"join club." You can join any club, but not all clubs have events. To make sure you add some clubs that
have events so you can see how the Events feature works, we recommend joining Meditiation Club or
Photography Club, for example.

Now that you've joined some clubs, you can return to the dashboard and see that it's no longer empty.
Clicking the box with a club name will take you to the individual club page, where you can see a club
description, general information, upcoming events, club members, and notes.

The "notifications" page on the sidebar will lead you to a page where you can see all of the notifications
for all of your clubs in one location. The "upcoming events" page on the sidebar leads you to a page that
has two tables; one for the events specific to your clubs and one for all events that have been marked as
public that all members of the Harvard community are invited to. From this page, you can add an event to
your Google calendar, and the event will be pre-populated with all of the information (location, description,
event name, date, and time) for ease of use. You can also RSVP to each event, which will add the event to
your dashboard so that you can easily see which events, public or private, you have said that you would
attend.

You can also go to the "create club" tab on the sidebar, which will take you to a form where you can input
information about a new club. By creating the club, you automatically become an admin for it and have editing
priviledges and the ability to make a new event for the club, which users are only to do if they create
a club or become an admin for the club through the "become an admin" link. You can click through and experiment
with the "become an admin," "edit club," and "create event" pages-- they are all self-explanatory. You will
only be able to edit the clubs for which you are an admin.

Another feature of OneCampus is the profile feature. If you go to your club dashboard and click on a club,
such as the Mountaineering Club, and scroll down to the bottom of the club page, you'll be able to see
a list of users in that club. If you click on the user's name, you will be taken to their profile, where you
can see their name, year, school, description, and a list of their clubs. You can also click on the Facebook
and Twitter icons (if they have linked their social media to their profile) to get into contact with the user
over social media. You can edit your own profile by clicking on the "manage profile" page on the sidebar.

Thanks and enjoy!
